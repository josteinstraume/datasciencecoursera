# Project Overview
> One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

# Overview of run_analysis.R
> run_analysis.R calls upon run_analysis.Rmd to download, munge, and export the running data to the desired file formats. Additionally, the program also calls upon codebook.Rmd to create the required codebook for this project. From there, run_analysis.R utilizes Knitr and Markdown to convert both called upon programs into markdown, and then into HTML.
